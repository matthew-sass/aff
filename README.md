### Blog Thumbnails - 4:5 aspect ratio, minimum 600px width 
### Gallery Thumbnails - Any aspect ratio, minimum 600px width 400px height
### Gallery Photos - Any aspect ratio, minimum 600px width

If we find we need to save space in the future, the images can be compressed to WEBP format which is the file format of a lot of the images on the demo, this can be done through [Squoosh](https://squoosh.app/) but is not necessary for the site to work.  

### TODO: Contact write up, About page write up, more thorough home page design
